    <p><b>What is guake-indicator?</b></p>
    <blockquote> Guake-indicator is a C software application designed for Ubuntu
      13.10 and 14.04 with Unity that lets you manage your favorite ssh hosts
      establishing a new ssh connection with <a
      href="http://guake.org">Guake</a>.
      Guake is a top-down terminal written in Python by Max Ulidtko,Pierre-Yves Chibon,
      Aleksandar Krsteski, Lincoln de Sousa, Gabriel Falcão.<br>
      Guake-indicator sticks to your "Ubuntu System Tray" and displays your
      favorites ssh hosts retrieved from
      ~/.guake.indicator/guake-indicator.json. If guake-indicator.json does not
      exist, guake-indicator will create a default one with a single "localhost"
      entry. The default configuration file looks like this:
      <p><a href="guake-indicator.json">guake-indicator.json</a><br>
      <p>
      You can customize this file according to your needs with your favorite
      text editor, and just use this sample as a base to add new entries. The fields
      are&nbsp; self-explanatory, however, I'm going to give you a more in-depth
      description of each one:
      <ul>
        <li>hostname : the host to connect (it can be his IP address or his
        DNS), leave it blank to execute commands directly on localhost</li>
        <li>login : the ssh user</li>
        <li>menu_name : the name that will show up in the indicator itself</li>
        <li>tab_name : the name of the guake terminal tab once it is opened</li>
        <li>command_after_login : command to issue after the ssh login is
        successfully performed - this field is optional</li>
        <li>remote_command : if set to yes, after that "command_after_login"
        is executed, the bash shell won't be invoked so an automatic exit is
        performed.</li>
        <li>x_forwarded : if set to yes it adds the -X flag.This tells SSH to
        forward the X server calls to the client computer (available from
        version 0.2).</li>
        <li>dont_show_guake : if set to yes guake is not shown after the
        command execution</li>
      </ul>
      
      Lately I got a lot of request about introducing support for various ssh
      options.
      I am fully aware that the ssh options currently supported by
      guake-indicator are just a few but supporting all of them
      would make guake-indicator too messy and heavy.
      I have a solution for that and you'll see it in the next release, in
      the meantime there's a workaround:
      don't use the hostname and login fields, leave them
      blanks, in this way only 'command after login' is executed.
      Put your ssh customized command in the command after login field or
      whatever command you like and guake-indicator won't be just a ssh
      connection manager anymore but a fully customizable guake command
      manager.
      For example here's how i use guake-indicator for launching Dota2
      through Steam:
      <pre>
	{
		"hostname":"",
		"login":"",
		"menu_name":"Dota2",
		"tab_name":"Dota2",
		"command_after_login":"steam
		steam:\/\/rungameid\/570",
		"remote_command":"no",
		"x_forwarded":"no",
		"dont_show_guake":"yes"
	}
      </pre>
      We're looking for beta tester and contributors in general for the next release,
      if you want to be part of this email/facebook/g+/skype me.

    <p><b>Guake version < 0.4.5 on Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04 show screen
    issue</b></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Each time a guake-indicator entry is clicked, Guake shows up.
    This is accomplished by a dbus call to the "Guake show interface".
    Unfortunately this interface is only present on Guake 0.4.5, in previous
    versions there's only a "Guake show-hide interface".
    The show-hide interface causes guake-indicator to hide Guake if it's already
    open, therefore, on old Guake versions, Guake hides himself if you click on a
    guake-indicator entry while Guake terminal is shown on the screen.
    You can upgrade Guake to 0.4.5 from <a
    href="https://launchpad.net/~ulidtko/+archive/guake/+packages">https://launchpad.net/~ulidtko/+archive/guake/+packages</a>.
    Currently (April 2014) the latest official Ubuntu Package is updated at version
    0.4.4 even in the Trusty Thar repositories.

    <p><b>Guake version >= 0.4.3-3 on Ubuntu 13.10 autorenaming
    issue</b></p>
    <blockquote>
    	<p>I noticed that Ubuntu 13.10 ships with a guake that auto-renames
    	each tab every time a change dir command is issued. In this way the
    	'tab_name' field within guake-indicator.json is completely useless
    	because guake overrides this value.
    	In order to solve this:
    	<ul>
    		<li> install gconf-editor package to edit Guake
	    	options ( sudo apt-get install gconf-editor ).
	    	<li>Execute gconf-editor from a terminal
	    	<li>Browse to /apps/guake/general and unmark use_vte_titles key
	    	<li>restart Guake
    	</ul>
